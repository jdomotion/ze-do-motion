# **Motion Syntax**  

## **Welcome to Motion Syntax!**  

Inspired by the structured approach of [Joy of VEX](https://tokeru.com/cgwiki/JoyOfVex.html), this guide takes a systematic approach to learning expressions in After Effects, focusing on motion syntax as a powerful tool for procedural animation. It’s not a full coding manual, but rather a structured learning path to help motion designers master essential expressions and procedural techniques.  

This isn’t a deep dive into coding or a step-by-step After Effects tutorial. Instead, think of it as a hands-on guide—a mix of essential concepts, exercises, and real-world applications designed to help you actually use expressions in your motion design work.  

You won’t master expressions overnight, but through structured exercises and practical applications, you’ll build a strong foundation. Each lesson is designed to reinforce learning, giving you the tools to automate animations, craft procedural motion, and design responsive effects efficiently.
