# Getting Started with After Effects

So, you’ve decided to dive into the world of Motion Design in After Effects? Good choice! When I first started, everything felt overwhelming—so many buttons, hidden menus, and no idea where to begin. Over time, I figured out shortcuts, tricks, and workflows that made everything feel more intuitive. This space exists to document all of that: what I’ve learned, what I wish I had learned earlier, and what I’m still figuring out.  

This blog isn’t just about expressions, even though I like them a lot. The idea is to talk about Motion Design as a whole—from the basics to complete animation projects. I’ll be sharing full animations, testing new techniques, and showing solutions to common problems in After Effects.  

## First steps in After Effects  

If you’re just getting started, here are some good first steps:  

### The basics I wish I had learned earlier  
I’m working on a **[Beginner’s Guide](#)**, collecting everything that would have made my life easier in the beginning.  

### Exploring expressions  
I’ve written about **[Values](/after-effects/expressions/introduction.html#understanding-values-in-expressions)**, **[Random](/after-effects/expressions/introduction.html#random-motion-wiggle)**, and **[Loops](/after-effects/expressions/introduction.html#looping-animations-loopout)** if you want to see how expressions can help automate animations.  

### Creating animations  
Beyond just the technical side, I want to develop **full projects**, showing the entire animation process from start to finish.  

### The fun side of expressions  
**[Motion Syntax](/after-effects/motion-syntax/)** is where I break down expressions in a more relaxed way, with practical examples and real-world applications.  

## What’s next in your motion design journey?  

I don’t know if you’re into gaming, but for me, learning After Effects feels a lot like playing a new game. At first, you’re lost, unsure which skills to level up, and everything seems overwhelming. But over time, you start figuring things out, discovering shortcuts, and unlocking new abilities that make everything smoother.

Just like in an RPG, there’s also that heavy grind—repeating tasks, testing new things, and failing a bunch of times until you finally master them.

### Doing quests  
Watching tutorials and learning new techniques helps unlock new areas of the map.  

### Grinding XP  
The grind is real! The more you practice, the easier things get.  

### Finding the right party  
Sharing your work, seeing what others are doing, and getting feedback speeds up learning.  

### Improving over time  
With each project, you gain experience, refine your techniques, and start working more efficiently. The progress isn’t always linear, but every challenge you overcome makes a difference.

This blog isn’t a course or a definitive guide—it’s just a place where I document what I’m learning and what I’ve already figured out. If any of this helps you, great! If not, at least it’s a record of how I got here.
